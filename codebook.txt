Source Data Info
The Source data is the result of an  experiments  been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. For  more info please check the URL listed above as "Source of raw Data"

The Source data was downloaded and processed and a set of 81 variables were extracted and transformed. The description of the final transformed variables stored on a new dataset named "tidyDataset" is given below.

The variables with S.No 3 to 81 are transformed variables with original names preserved. For more details on the original variables please refer to "features.info.txt" inside  the source dataset zip file.

The dataset dimension is as follows
